This repository contains algorithms I encounter as a 
teaching assistant on "Logic in Computer Science" at DIKU.
We are following the book "Logic in Computer Science" by Michael Huth and Mark Ryan,
so the algorithms are likely from there.

This is quick 'n dirty implementation for educational purposes, not meant to be used seriously. 

All files a literal haskell.
That means you can convert them to nice readable documents (pdf,html,etc..)
and also load them up in GHC using your favorite editor and start playing with them.

Happy hacking!
